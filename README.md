# Creative D

## Preparation

* I have created User stories so that I could set specific goals for myself. I created some milestones so that I can better organize my time and focus my effort on a specific objective that I set for myself. I also created a project with 3 columns - To do column, In progress column and Done column. I created them so that i can clearly follow the specific goal that i set for myself.

* Things that i did
   + User Stories
   + labels for those User Stories (To Better organize my priorities)
   + Milestones "iteration1", "iteration2" and "iteration3"
   + I also made a project with 3 columns so that i can keep track on my progression.

## Design process

* Before starting my project I thought about how I am going to structure and design my project. The first step I took was to create a diagram on my notes book (a basic sketch of what the website would look like).

* I chose this color pattern of ...

* I wrote some notes down on what I needed to add to my project so that I won't forget later.

* I began creating a more detailed wireframe on the "InVision" website.

* I turned my basic notes into User stories and then created iterations.
